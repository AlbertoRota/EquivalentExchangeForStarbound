First of all, congratulations on obtaining your very own ^orange;Universal transmutation tablet^reset;!

You have now reached the very end-game and are now an expert alchemist, you can be proud of that.

Doing this mod took quite a bunch of time and effort, but it's great to see you fully exploring it.
