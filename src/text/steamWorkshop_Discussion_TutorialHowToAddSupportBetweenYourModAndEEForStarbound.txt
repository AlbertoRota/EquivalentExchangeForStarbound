[h1] Preface [/h1]
This tutorial is intended to help other modders to add compatibility between their mods and "EE for Starbound".

If you are not the author of the mod, but you want to see it integrated with "EE for Starbound", please ask the author to take a look here.

If you are the mod author, welcome.

[h1] TL;DR: [/h1]
[olist]
    [*]Create a file named "EES_transmutationstudylist.config.patch" in the root of your mod.
    [*]In that file, add one patch operation per item you want to be "Studyable"

[h1] In detail: [/h1]
[b]Create the ".patch" file.[/b]
Create a file named "EES_transmutationstudylist.config.patch" in the root of your mod.
This file will be used to patch my own "EES_transmutationstudylist.config" file, where all the "Studyable" items are listed.
Make sure that it is in the root of your mod (Same level as "player.config.patch")

[b]Add the patch operations.[/b]
You will need to add one patch operation per item you want to add.
The patch operation should be as follows:
[code]{ "op": "add", "path": "/[mine|farm|hunt]/[T1|T2|T3]/<itemName>", "value": true}[/code]
Let me clarify it:
[list]
    [*][b][mine|farm|hunt][/b]
    [list]
        [*][i]mine[/i] if it's an ore or simmilar.
        [*][i]farm[/i] if it's a plant or simmilar.
        [*][i]hunt[/i] if it's an mob drop or simmilar.
    [/list]
    [*][b][T1|T2|T3][/b]
    [list]
        [*][i]T1[/i] if it's an early-game item.
        [*][i]T2[/i] if it's a mid-game.
        [*][i]T3[/i] if it's an end-game item.
    [/list]
    [*][b]<itemName>[/b]
    [list]
        [*]The [i]"itemName"[/i] of your item.
    [/list]
[/list]
Example:
[code][
    { "op": "add", "path": "/mine/T1/ironore", "value": true},
    { "op": "add", "path": "/farm/T2/coralcreep", "value": true},
    { "op": "add", "path": "/hunt/T3/cryonicextract", "value": true}
][/code]


[b]Finish.[/b]
That's all you need to do.
If you want to check it, just start your game with both mods installed and check if you can study it in the expected table, at the expected level.
If it fails, don't hesitate to contact me. ːsteamhappyː

[b]Tips for choosing items.[/b]
[olist]
    [*]Choose always only the bare minimum materials to add, if something can be crafted from other materials, let the players craft it, if not (Mined, farmed or dropped by a monster) consider to add it.
[/olist]
